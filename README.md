# EdgeDetection
Image Processing: Edge Detection using Open CV and TensorFlow 

## Objective 
Canny algorithm is used for edge detection. This is a quick start program for using open CV2.

## About Canny algorithm 

The following simple steps are followed for edge detection using Canny algorithm,

1. Read the image, given the image path 
2. Apply Gaussian blur  
3. Use Canny algorithm using Open CV for edge Detection
